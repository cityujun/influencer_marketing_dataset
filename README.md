# Multi-Platform Influencer Marketing Dataset

This is the multi-platform influencer marketing dataset collected from the same group of 93 opinion leaders who have accounts both on Weibo and WeChat.

As a result, the dataset contains various numeric metrics that reflect on the level of user engagement of posted blogs as well blog content.

Here, due to privacy preserving, we only make the numeric part public.
If you would have access to the second part, i.e., textual content, please feel free to contact us by email.

If you would utilize our dataset, please cite our paper `An Empirical Study of User Engagement in Influencer Marketing on Weibo and WeChat`.

Many thanks.
